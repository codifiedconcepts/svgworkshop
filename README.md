# Intro To Writing SVG Workshop 

Slides, curriculum notes, and recources for an in person 2.5 hour workshop for adults based on [Pocket Guide to Writing SVG](http://svgpocketguide.com/book/).

**Title**: Intro To Writing SVG<br>
**Grade Level**: Adult<br>
**Experience Level**: Beginner<br>
**Total Time**: 2.5 hours<br>
**Curriculum**: Based on the book [Pocket Guide to Writing SVG](http://svgpocketguide.com/book/) by Joni Trythall<br>
**Objective**: By the end of this workshop students will have a foundational understanding of SVG syntax and the benefits of using it this way over alternative approaches, such as an `img`. With base CodePen demos in place with instructions together we will get started right away writing and editing basic SVG shapes in the browser. Students will learn first-hand about the SVG workspace and sizing and get to make significant changes to the code of a more complex graphic (grapes!) and then jump into using SVG text.<br>
**Topics Covered**: What SVG is, why SVG is awesome, syntax, document organization, writing basic shapes, editing complex graphics in the browser, writing and editing SVG text<br>
**Presentation Format**: slides, CodePen demos, hands on building<br>
**Materials**: Computers, CodePen, Chrome (pre-installed), [CodePen demos](http://codepen.io/collection/DVYpJK/), [reference site](http://jonitrythall.github.io/svgintro/), [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PZZnf0Z9uViwX8ma4gnbT8BGybIiAygLf_LOkdhclAY/edit?usp=sharing), [Pocket Guide to Writing SVG](http://svgpocketguide.com/book/)<br>
